# ROS2-BetterExamples-cpp
A collection of ROS2 C++ code examples and tutorial docs

This repository contains C++ code examples for the ROS2(Robot Operating System 2) framework. The goal is to help beginners quickly learn ROS2 framework and how it can be applied on actual robots, therefore these examples are slightly more sophisticated, in a meaningful way with more usage variants/details, than the [official ROS2 rclcpp examples](https://github.com/ros2/examples/tree/master/rclcpp).
    

The examples are organized in separate packages such that it would be easy to copy-paste into your own project. Docs explaining ROS2 concepts/commands and step-by-step guides are also provided. 

For beginners, reading the [ROS2 official tutorial](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials.html) is highly recommended before using the example code in this repository.

(developing, checkout the dev branch for the latest progress)
